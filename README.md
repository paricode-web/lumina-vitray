* **NextAuth** — authentication

## 🏗 Architecture

The project uses the Next.js App Router and separates server-side database operations from client-side interactive components.

### Main areas

* `app/` — routes, pages, server actions and API routes
* `components/` — reusable UI components
* `lib/` — shared utilities, stores and payment logic
* `prisma/` — Prisma schema and database migrations
* `public/` — static assets
* `types/` — TypeScript type extensions

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

The application includes:

* User registration
* Credential-based login
* Password hashing with bcryptjs
* Session-based authentication with NextAuth
* Role-based access for the admin dashboard
* Protected checkout functionality

## 🛒 E-commerce Flow

The main shopping flow is:

**Products → Cart → Checkout → Order → Payment → Success**

Product prices and stock are validated on the server instead of trusting values stored in the client-side cart.

## 💳 Payment Flow

The project currently uses a **fake payment flow** for demonstration and learning purposes.

The flow is:

**Create Order → Start Payment → Payment Authority → Verify Payment → Mark Order as Paid**

No real payment gateway is connected.

## 👨‍💼 Admin Panel

The admin dashboard provides functionality for:

* Creating products
* Updating products
* Deleting products
* Uploading product images
* Viewing orders
* Viewing users and order information

## 📱 Responsive Design

The interface is designed to work across:

* Desktop
* Tablet
* Mobile
